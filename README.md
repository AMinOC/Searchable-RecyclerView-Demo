An example app using a `SearchView` to filter items in a `RecyclerView` while taking full advantage of item animations!

 - **Item Animations are supported starting with Honeycomb (Android 3.0, API level 11)!**

You can find a complete walkthrough of how to implement this [**on Stack Overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30429439/2310866).
